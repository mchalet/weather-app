## Weather App Challenge

TODOS:
1. Currently, API calls for the forecast are hard coded to 10 days. Attempts to dynamically insert a count from the form breaks the API call. Need to investigate cause.
2. Find cause of 'computedMatch' error in dev tool console.
3. Add unit testing, form validation, and test edge cases.
4. Fix up gritty UI and styling.


### Getting Started

1. Clone locally.
2. Navigate to `/client` and `/server`.
3. Run `npm install` in each directory.
4. Run `npm start` in each directory.
5. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

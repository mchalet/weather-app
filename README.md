## Weather App Challenge

TODOS:
1. Currently, API calls for the forecast are hard coded to 10 days. Attempts to dynamically insert a count from the form break the API call. Need to investigate cause.
2. Fix up the gritty UI and styling.


### Getting Started

1. Clone locally.
2. Navigate to `/client` and `/server`.
3. Run `npm install` in each directory.
4. Run `npm start` in each directory.
5. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
